# mem-portfolio-website

A static webpage which I am developing as a personal portfolio using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The page is lightweight, responsive, and can be customized easily as well if you would like to add your own images and information.

## Features

- Lightweight, static personal webpage
- Carousel with three large panels featuring header and sub-text
- Responsive timeline showcasing career history
- Smooth navigation to anchor links using JavaScript [Smooth scroll](https://github.com/cferdinandi/smooth-scroll/).

## Usage

To make use of the website, simply download the code and make edits as needed to the images, style and html pages.

All styles are in css/master.css or referenced externally directly in the index file. At this point, the page is ready to go and you can begin to add your own information and make any needed changes.
